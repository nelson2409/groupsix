        <h2>Rich Art and Cultural Heritage of Tanzania</h2>
        <p>
         <h4><b>Ethnic diversity</b></h4>
Tanzania is home to over 120 ethnic groups, each with their own language, customs, and traditions.
 Some of the most prominent groups include the Maasai, Chagga, and Sukuma.    
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Art</b></h4>
Tanzanian art includes wood carvings, colorful textiles, and captivating performances. Wood carvings are a notable form of Tanzanian art, with skilled artisans using traditional techniques to create sculptures of human figures, animals, and mythological creatures. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Music and Dance</b></h4>
            Tanzania's traditional music and dance are a reflection of its cultural diversity. Oral storytelling and tribal dancing are important parts of rural cultural life. The Ngoma dance is performed at weddings, harvest festivals, and initiation ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><b>Cultural institutions</b></h4>
            The National Museum in Dar es Salaam houses archaeological items, including the Zinjanthropus boisei skull discovered by Mary Leakey in 1959.
        </p>
        <p>
         <h4><b>Historical crossroads</b></h4>

        <h2>Top Tourist Places to Visit</h2>

        <div class="tourist-place">
            <h3>1. Serengeti National Park</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>The greatest wildlife destination on earth</h4>
                <b>The magic of Serengeti National Park</b> is not easy to describe in words. Not only seeing, but also hearing the buzz of millions of wildebeest so thick in the air that it vibrates through your entire body is something you will try to describe to friends and family, before realising it’s impossible. Vistas of honey-lit plains at sunset so beautiful, it’s worth the trip just to witness this. The genuine smiles of the Maasai people, giving you an immediate warming glow inside.
                 Or just the feeling of constantly being amongst thousands of animals – it doesn’t matter what season of the migration you visit the Serengeti National Park, it’s magical all year round.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>The never-ending circle of the Great Migration</h4>
                <b>Serengeti National Park was one</b> of the first sites listed as a World Heritage Site when United Nations delegates met in Stockholm in 1981. Already by the late 1950s, this area had been recognised as a unique ecosystem, providing us with many insights into how the natural world functions and showing us how dynamic ecosystems really are.

Today, most visitors come here with one aim alone: to witness millions of wildebeest, zebras, gazelles and elands on a mass trek to quench their thirst for water and eat fresh grass. During this great cyclical movement, these ungulates move around the ecosystem in a seasonal pattern, defined by rainfall and grass nutrients. These large herds of animals on the move can’t be witnessed anywhere else.
 Whereas other famous wildlife parks are fenced, the Serengeti is protected, but unfenced. Giving animals enough space to make their return journey, one that they’ve been doing for millions of years.

            <h3>2. Mount Kilimanjaro</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>The history of Mount Kilimanjaro</h4>
                Mount Kilimanjaro’s three peaks were formed after volcanic eruptions millions of years ago. One volcanic cone, Shira, is now extinct and eroded, while the other two, Mawenzi and Kibo, ‘melted’ together after subsequent eruptions. Kibo is now the highest with its famous Uhuru peak at almost 6000m above sea level.

There is no single explanation for Kilimanjaro’s name and there are many theories as to where it comes from. Local peoples have looked at Kilimanjaro with reverence and named it 
‘Mountain of Greatness’ (Swahili) or ‘That which defeats the caravan’ (Chagga) or ‘White Mountain’ (Maasai). The Maasai have also called it the `The mountain of Water’, as it is the source of water for the area.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Kilimanjaro National Park</h4>
                At 5,895 m, Kilimanjaro is the highest point in Africa. This volcanic massif stands in splendid isolation above the surrounding plains, with its snowy peak looming over the savannah.
                 The mountain is encircled by mountain forest. Numerous mammals, many of them endangered species, live in the park.

            <p>
                <h4>Why Visit Zanzibar ?</h4>
                Zanzibar is the home of idyllic beaches, balmy weather & warm tropical waters.This archipelago is renowned for clear warm waters, coral reefs and rich marine diversity making it a perfect under-water destination for snorkelling and diving. If it is lazy days along white sandy beaches that you are after - Zanzibar is hard to beat. But, in addition to the perfect beach destination,
                 Zanzibar is also full of options for nature lovers, culture vultures, and adventurers.

                <h4>Beach & Marine Life</h4>
                The beaches of Zanzibar are a wonder to behold, with soft white sand and shimmering waters. From the stunning northern beaches of Nungwi and Kendwa to the serene southeastern coast of Jambiani, Zanzibar has something for every beach lover. Visitors can soak up the sun,
                 take a dip in the warm waters, or take part in a range of water sports activities such as snorkeling, diving, and kite surfing.

            <h4>Stone Town of Zanzibar</h4>
            The Stone Town of Zanzibar is a fine example of the Swahili coastal trading towns of East Africa. It retains its urban fabric and townscape virtually intact and contains many fine buildings that reflect its particular culture,
             which has brought together and homogenized disparate elements of the cultures of Africa, the Arab region, India, and Europe over more than a millennium.

            <h3>4. Ngorongoro Crater</h3>
            <p>
               <h4>Ngorongoro Conservation Area</h4>
               The Ngorongoro Conservation Area spans vast expanses of highland plains, savanna, savanna woodlands and forests. Established in 1959 as a multiple land use area, with wildlife coexisting with semi-nomadic Maasai pastoralists practicing traditional livestock grazing, it includes the spectacular Ngorongoro Crater, the world’s largest caldera. The property has global importance for biodiversity conservation due to the presence of globally threatened species, the density of wildlife inhabiting the area,
                and the annual migration of wildebeest, zebra, gazelles and other animals into the northern plains. Extensive archaeological research has also yielded a long sequence of evidence of human evolution and human-environment dynamics, including early hominid footprints dating back 3.6 million years.

                <h4>What is so special about the Ngorongoro Crater?</h4>
                What is Unique About Ngorongoro Crater? Other than being the biggest intact (unbroken) volcanic caldera on Earth,
                 the Ngorongoro Crater is also a natural sanctuary for some of the densest populations of large mammals in Africa. Due to its enclosed nature, the Ngorongoro Crater has effectively formed its own ecosystem.
